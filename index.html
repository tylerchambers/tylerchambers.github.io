		<aside>Some things that I've built, that I enjoy.</aside>
		<h3>FOSS Contributions</h3>
		<em><a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin">Bitcoin Core</a></em>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20346"
					>PR #20346</a
				>
				- Modified security-check.py to use <code>==</code> instead of
				<code>is</code> for literal comparison in line with a new
				standard in Python 3.8.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20468"
					>PR #20468</a
				>
				- Standardized <code>--version</code> flag behavior between CLI
				utilities and added functionality in
				<code>gen-manpages.sh</code> to error when attempting to
				generate man pages for binaries built from a dirty branch.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22591"
					>PR #22591</a
				>
				- Updated bitcoin-qt client to present an error if
				<code>settings.json</code> exists but is not readable (incorrect
				permissions), instead of overwriting.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Personal</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<a href="https://github.com/tylerchambers/electrum-client"
					>Electrum Client</a
				>
				- An
				<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Electrum">electrum</a>
				client library written in Python focused on simplicity and
				usability.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="https://github.com/tylerchambers/aptlib">AptLib</a> - A
				Go library for interacting with APT repositories. Unfinished.
				Currently able to parse <code>sources.list</code> files and
				download + parse package indicies. Can currently out perform the
				main apt implementation included in debian and ubuntu, as it
				downloads and parses sources concurrently. More gains could be
				made by making use of Cache-Control, ETag, and Last-Modified
				headers. I paused work on this as I became busy at my main job,
				and frustrated with the breadth of APT's functionality. If I
				were to resume this sort of work it would be re-done in Rust to
				take advantage of its fast regex, and limit focus to only
				handling HTTP/HTTPS repositories (most common). It would likely
				also be useful to have an apt daemon running in the background
				to keep your sources fresh (autoupdate?), and a CLI to interact
				with it.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="https://github.com/tylerchambers/bitcoin-rest"
					>Bitcoin REST</a
				>
				- A REST API gateway that passes Bitcoin Core RPC calls to a
				running Bitcoin Core instance and returns its response.
			</li>
		</ul>
